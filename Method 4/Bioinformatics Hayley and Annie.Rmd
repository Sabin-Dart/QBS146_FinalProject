To screen biomarkers, we calculated the importance of diagnostic genes using three machine learning methods: random forest model (RF), support vector machine model (SVM), and generalized linear model (GLM) 


The models were analyzed using the “DALEX” R package (version 2.3.0) to plot residual distributions, and algorithmic power box line plots to obtain the best model from which biomarkers were obtained
```{r}
#install.packages("DALEX")
library(DALEX)
```





The nomogram of biomarkers was constructed using the “RMS” (version 6.1-0) R package to derive the relationship between biomarkers and diseases, and the calibration curves plotted by “RMS” (version 6.1-0) R package were used to validate the model


```{r}
#install.packages("rms")
library(rms)
```
