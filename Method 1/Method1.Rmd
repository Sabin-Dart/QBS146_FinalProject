# 1.
DMCs were obtained by comparing the methylation sites of VV and normal samples
in the GSE68319 dataset using the "ChAMP" (version 2.20.1) R package with a 
screening condition of p < 0.05 

# 2.
The "Rideogram" R package (version 0.2.2) was then used to visualize the chromosome annotation information of DMCs 

# 3. 
Finally, we compared the distribution of CpG sites in different regions within 
genes to obtain differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using the "UpSetR"
(version 1.4.0) R package
